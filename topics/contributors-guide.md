<!-- Are PowerApps and Flow PMs different than other PMs? Is the following still needed? -->
- **PowerApps and Flow PMs who already contribute to docs**: Currently, use the (legacy) forking model, which is still supported. This guide introduces them to work directly in their own branches in our repo by granting **"write"** access. You are already familiar with this model from your work on Release Notes. See [Get started](get-started.md) to request write access to PowerApps and Flow repos.
