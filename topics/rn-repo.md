# Explore the Release Notes repo


<!-- Note that the link in the first paragraph goes to April and earlier release notes. Add links to Wave 2 for D365 and Power Platform. -->


The root of the [release plans repo](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/BusinessApplication-ReleaseNotes) contains an **articles** folder. For example, it might contain: 

- **April19** folder, for features that release between April and September 2019 and for preview features going into preview between February and July 2019. 
- **October18** folder, for features that released between October 2018 and March 2019 (inclusive).

Each version folder (for example, April19, October18, and April18) contains:

- **toc.md**, which controls the left nav for all products in that release.
- **change-history.md**, which contains information about additions, deletions, and other changes in all products in that release.
- a folder for each product area.

Each product-area folder contains:

- a topic that summarizes the product area (named **index.md**).
- a topic that indicates a release date for each feature (named **planned-features.md**).
- a topic for each feature.
