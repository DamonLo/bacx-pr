# Authoring process

**Important:** Your steps will start in the Release Planner tool, not in GitHub. 

<!-- The following paragraphs aren't current. Content should be created in the tool. 

Here is the general process to use when you want to add a feature or make changes to a feature that is already covered in the Release Notes. 

If you are not familiar with using GitHub, please first read the [Contributors Guide](contributors-guide.md), in particular [Get started](get-started.md) and [Work directly in our repos](work-repos.md).

PMs: A best practice is to create your own branch off of the working branch, and then make all your changes to it for the feature or features you are working on. For example, if you update the description and target release date for a feature, you would create one branch and then make your changes to the feature's topic, the summary of whatâ€™s new topic, and change history topic all as part of one pull request (PR). 

**Warning:** Once anyone merges a PR into master, it can go live at any time. Never merge into master until you are ready for information about your feature to be public knowledge.
