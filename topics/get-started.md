# Contributors guide: Get started

Our content is created in the [Release Planner tool](https://aka.ms/bagreleasenotes) and hosted on GitHub. You'll need to be familiar with both.

## Get started with the Release Planner tool

<!--Is emailing that alias the way to request access? -->

You'll need to request access to the Release Planner tool. Send your request to rntoolfeedback@microsoft.com. 

To learn how to add, review, or update content in the tool, see these resources (available under Resources in the left navigation pane of the tool):

- [BAG Release Planner App Guide](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/:w:/t/ProjectBahnhof/EYBGZgE9Js5CioBE2LAIjSwBCgn_hvM9QtZ7gPimS85vkQ?rtime=RWW9laMl10g) 
- [Demo video](https://msit.microsoftstream.com/video/c78b4dec-e4c3-4cd9-b827-c6535c11757a?list=studio)

## Create GitHub account and join our org

As a content author, you will need to provide your GitHub ID in the Release Planner Tool to reflect on the release notes. 

If you don't already have a GitHub account, follows these steps:

1.  [Create a GitHub account](https://github.com/join) using your
    **\@Microsoft.com** email with 2-Factor Auth enabled.
    
    If you already have a GitHub account, ensure that you change/set the primary
    email ID as your **\@Microsoft.com** email.
    
    You must ensure that your GitHub profile info adheres to the profile requirements listed in the next section. 

2.  Join the **MicrosoftDocs** org:
    <https://repos.opensource.microsoft.com/MicrosoftDocs>

3.  Request write access to [our repos](#our-repos) by joining the following group:
    <https://github.com/orgs/MicrosoftDocs/teams/bacx-contribute/members>

> [!CAUTION]
> You must print or save your recovery codes so that you can
access your account in the event you lose access to your device and cannot
receive two-factor authentication codes. Your recovery codes are available here:
<https://github.com/settings/auth/recovery-codes>

- **Profile picture**: A picture of you (required).
- **Name**: Your first and last name (required).
- **Public email**: Your Microsoft email address (optional).
